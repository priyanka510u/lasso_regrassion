This repository contains two projects demonstrating the application of Lasso Regression, focusing on sales prediction and feature selection across different datasets.

#Projects

1)Ice Cream Sales Prediction

Description: This project involves predicting ice cream sales based on temperature. Lasso Regression is used to analyze the relationship between these variables and forecast sales.

2)Sales Data of Dummy HSS
